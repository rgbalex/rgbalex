Hello there👋

A University of York computer science student by day and software developer by night
Jira appreciator with Agile values

Experience encompassing all elements of development from Scrum to Agile, embedded development to webservers and microservices, 
GitHub Enterprise to Bitbucket, and from Blazor and WASM or Python right back down to C. Always ready to learn.

I ❤️ Jetbrains IDEA Software :)
