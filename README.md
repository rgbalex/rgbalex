Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander

I am a University of York student of Computer Science in my 3rd year of University.
Developing in my spare time has currently taken a backseat thanks to my time spent working on university projects and coursework, but I am striving to get back into something new!
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Discord, C/C++/C#, Webmin, Linux and more!
A lot of my time has been spent learning about web servers and hosting environments. I have helped set up websites for customers - right from domain name registration through to web framework choice, hosting and AdSense.
I am looking to expand my horizons in this area!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about MudBlazor, and use this framework both at work and at home.
- I am also interested in Micronaut and Kafka as I have been using this at University
- ðŸ“« Reach me via Discord @rgbalex
