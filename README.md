Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander

I am a University of York student of Computer Science in my 3rd year and I am currently on placement within ETAS/Bosch in York.
Developing in my spare time has currently taken a backseat thanks to my development work at my 9-5 but I am striving to get back into something new!
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Discord, C#, Webmin, Linux and more!
A lot of my time has been spent learning about web-servers and hosting environments. I have helped setup websites for customers - right from domain name registration through to web framework choice, hosting and AdSense.
I am looking to expand my horizons in this area!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about MudBlazor, and use this framework both at work and at home. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - (if you want a response in a timely manner) via discord @rgbalex#0001
